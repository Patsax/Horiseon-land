The marketing agency named Horiseon has requested a landing page that tells prospective clients what services they offer.

The developer was given a base code to work with which was servicable. However, it was not very accesible for readers. As such, the developer endeavered to clean up the base HTML with better semantic elements to allow readers to communicate what the site was to visitors with difficulties reading the content of the page.

Various sections of the HTML had multiple class names that led to several redundant rules in the style sheet. The developer unified class names and removed the redundancies from the style sheet.

After testing all the changes the developer is satisfied that the page now meets the requirements of the client.
